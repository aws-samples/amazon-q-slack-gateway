      "snippet": "As you deploy these systems into live environments, we learn how well these systems perform and the consequences of those trade-offs. Based on what we have learned we have created the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which provides a consistent set of best practices for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and provides a set of questions you can use to evaluate how well an architecture is aligned to AWS best practices. The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. Table 1. The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. Table 1.  The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework Name Description Operational Excellence The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. Security The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. Reliability The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

In the AWS Well-Architected Framework we use these terms • A component is the code, configuration and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirement. A component is often the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other components. • We use the term workload to identify a set of components that together deliver business value."
